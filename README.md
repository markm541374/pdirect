<p>
The opt is normalized to [0,1]^D
A rectangle is a row of ints in G 
[state, num0, den0, num1, den1, ... ,size0, size1... ]

the center point is num/den so the starting value is 1/2
the half side length is 0.5/3^size so the starting value is 0
state is min(size) if the rectangle is active -1 otherwise
